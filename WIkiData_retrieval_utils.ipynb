He attributes this both to the rich endowments of the colleges at Oxford and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], which made the income of professors independent of their ability to attract students, and to the fact that distinguished [[Intellectual#Man of Letters|men of letters]] could make an even more comfortable living as ministers of the [[Church of England]].<ref name=\"Buchholz 1999 12\" />\\n\\nSmith\\'s discontent at Oxford might be in part due to the absence of his beloved teacher in Glasgow, Francis Hutcheson, who was well regarded as one of the most prominent lecturers at the University of Glasgow in his day and earned the approbation of students, colleagues, and even ordinary residents with the fervor and earnestness of his orations (which he sometimes opened to the public). His lectures endeavoured not merely to teach philosophy, but also to make his students embody that philosophy in their lives, appropriately acquiring the epithet, the preacher of philosophy. Unlike Smith, Hutcheson was not a system builder; rather, his magnetic personality and method of lecturing so influenced his students and caused the greatest of those to reverentially refer to him as \"the never to be forgotten Hutcheson\"—a title that Smith in all his correspondence used to describe only two people, his good friend David Hume and influential mentor Francis Hutcheson.<ref>Scott, W.&nbsp;R. \"The Never to Be Forgotten Hutcheson: Excerpts from W.&nbsp;R.

He based his explanation, not on a special \"moral sense\" as the [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Third Lord Shaftesbury]] and Hutcheson had done, nor on [[utilitarianism|utility]] as Hume did, but on mutual sympathy, a term best captured in modern parlance by the 20th-century concept of [[empathy]], the capacity to recognise feelings that are being experienced by another being.\\n\\n[[File:François Quesnay.jpg|thumb|upright|[[François Quesnay]], one of the leaders of the [[Physiocracy|physiocratic]] school of thought|alt=A drawing of a man sitting down]]\\nFollowing the publication of \\'\\'The Theory of Moral Sentiments\\'\\', Smith became so popular that many wealthy students left their schools in other countries to enroll at Glasgow to learn under Smith.<ref>{{harvnb|Buchholz|1999|p=15}}</ref> After the publication of \\'\\'The Theory of Moral Sentiments\\'\\', Smith began to give more attention to [[jurisprudence]] and economics in his lectures and less to his theories of morals.<ref>{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=67}}</ref> For example, Smith lectured that the cause of increase in national wealth is labour, rather than the nation\\'s quantity of gold or silver, which is the basis for [[mercantilism]], the [[economic theory]] that dominated Western European economic policies at the time.<ref>{{harvnb|Buchholz|1999|p=13}}</ref>\\n\\nIn 1762, the University of Glasgow conferred on Smith the title of [[Doctor of Law]]s (LL.D.).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/archives/exhibitions/smith/photogallery/honorarydegree/|title=MyGlasgow – Archive Services – Exhibitions – Adam Smith in Glasgow – Photo Gallery – Honorary degree|website=University of Glasgow|access-date=6 November 2018|archive-date=6 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181106132237/https://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/archives/exhibitions/smith/photogallery/honorarydegree/|url-status=live}}</ref> At the end of 1763, he obtained an offer from [[Charles Townshend]]—who had been introduced to Smith by David Hume—to tutor his stepson, [[Henry Scott, 3rd Duke of Buccleuch|Henry Scott]], the young Duke of Buccleuch.

He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it. By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it. I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good. It is an affectation, indeed, not very common among merchants, and very few words need be employed in dissuading them from it.</blockquote>\\n\\nThose who regard that statement as Smith\\'s central message also quote frequently Smith\\'s dictum:<ref>Smith, A., 1976, \\'\\'The Glasgow edition\\'\\', vol. 2a, pp. 26–27.</ref>\\n\\n<blockquote>It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves, not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their advantages.</blockquote>However, in \\'\\'The Theory of Moral Sentiments\\'\\' he had a more sceptical approach to self-interest as driver of behaviour:<blockquote>How selfish soever man may be supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature, which interest him in the fortune of others, and render their happiness necessary to him, though he derives nothing from it except the pleasure of seeing it.</blockquote>[[File:Wealth of Nations.jpg|thumb|upright|The first page of \\'\\'The Wealth of Nations\\'\\', 1776 London edition|alt=The first page of a book]]\\nSmith\\'s statement about the benefits of \"an invisible hand\" may be meant to answer{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} [[Bernard Mandeville|Mandeville]]\\'s contention that \"Private Vices ... may be turned into Public Benefits\".<ref>Mandeville, B., 1724, \\'\\'The Fable of the Bees\\'\\', London: Tonson.</ref> It shows Smith\\'s belief that when an individual pursues his self-interest under conditions of justice, he unintentionally promotes the good of society.

The proposal of any new law or regulation of commerce which comes from this order, ought always to be listened to with great precaution, and ought never be adopted till after having been long and carefully examined, not only with the most scrupulous, but with the most suspicious attention.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Gopnik |first=Adam |title=Market Man |magazine=[[The New Yorker]] |date=10 October 2010 |issue=18 October 2010 |page=82 |url=https://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2010/10/18/101018crbo_books_gopnik |access-date=27 April 2011 |archive-date=5 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110305185415/http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2010/10/18/101018crbo_books_gopnik |url-status=live }}</ref> Thus Smith\\'s chief worry seems to be when business is given special protections or privileges from government; by contrast, in the absence of such special political favours, he believed that business activities were generally beneficial to the whole society:\\n\\n<blockquote>It is the great multiplication of the production of all the different arts, in consequence of the division of labour, which occasions, in a well-governed society, that universal opulence which extends itself to the lowest ranks of the people. Every workman has a great quantity of his own work to dispose of beyond what he himself has occasion for; and every other workman being exactly in the same situation, he is enabled to exchange a great quantity of his own goods for a great quantity, or, what comes to the same thing, for the price of a great quantity of theirs. He supplies them abundantly with what they have occasion for, and they accommodate him as amply with what he has occasion for, and a general plenty diffuses itself through all the different ranks of society. (\\'\\'The Wealth of Nations,\\'\\' I.i.10)</blockquote>\\n\\nThe neoclassical interest in Smith\\'s statement about \"an invisible hand\" originates in the possibility of seeing it as a precursor of [[neoclassical economics]] and its concept of [[General equilibrium theory|general equilibrium]]; [[Paul Samuelson|Samuelson]]\\'s \"Economics\" refers six times to Smith\\'s \"invisible hand\". To emphasise this connection, Samuelson<ref>Samuelson, P.&nbsp;A./Nordhaus, William&nbsp;D., 1989, \\'\\'Economics\\'\\', 13th edition, N.Y. et al.: McGraw-Hill, p. 825.</ref> quotes Smith\\'s \"invisible hand\" statement substituting \"general interest\" for \"public interest\". Samuelson<ref>Samuelson, P.&nbsp;A./Nordhaus, William&nbsp;D., 1989, idem, p. 825.</ref> concludes: \"Smith was unable to prove the essence of his invisible-hand doctrine. Indeed, until the 1940s, no one knew how to prove, even to state properly, the kernel of truth in this proposition about perfectly competitive market.\"\\n\\n[[File:Smith - Inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations, 1922 - 5231847.tif|thumb|170px|1922 printing of \\'\\'An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations\\'\\']]\\nVery differently, classical economists see in Smith\\'s first sentences his programme to promote \"The Wealth of Nations\". Using the physiocratical concept of the economy as a circular process, to secure growth the inputs of Period 2 must exceed the inputs of Period 1. Therefore, those outputs of Period 1 which are not used or usable as inputs of Period 2 are regarded as unproductive labour, as they do not contribute to growth. This is what Smith had heard in France from, among others, [[François Quesnay]], whose ideas Smith was so impressed by that he might have dedicated \\'\\'The Wealth of Nations\\'\\' to him had he not died beforehand.<ref>{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=80}}</ref><ref>Stewart, D., 1799, \\'\\'Essays on Philosophical Subjects, to which is prefixed An Account of the Life and Writings of the Author by Dugald Steward, F.R.S.E.\\'\\', Basil; from the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, Read by M. Steward, 21 January, and 18 March 1793; in: The Glasgow edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith, 1982, vol. 3, pp. 304 ff.</ref> To this French insight that unproductive labour should be reduced to use labour more productively, Smith added his own proposal, that productive labour should be made even more productive by deepening the [[division of labour]]. Smith argued that deepening the division of labour under competition leads to greater productivity, which leads to lower prices and thus an increasing standard of living—\"general plenty\" and \"universal opulence\"—for all. Extended markets and increased production lead to the continuous reorganisation of production and the invention of new ways of producing, which in turn lead to further increased production, lower prices, and improved standards of living. Smith\\'s central message is, therefore, that under dynamic competition, a growth machine secures \"The Wealth of Nations\". Smith\\'s argument predicted Britain\\'s evolution as the workshop of the world, underselling and outproducing all its competitors. The opening sentences of the \"Wealth of Nations\" summarise this policy:\\n\\n<blockquote>The annual labour of every nation is the fund which originally supplies it with all the necessaries and conveniences of life which it annually consumes ... . [T]his produce ... bears a greater or smaller proportion to the number of those who are to consume it ... .[B]ut this proportion must in every nation be regulated by two different circumstances;\\n* first, by the skill, dexterity, and judgment with which its labour is generally applied; and,\\n* secondly, by the proportion between the number of those who are employed in useful labour, and that of those who are not so employed [emphasis added].<ref>Smith, A., 1976, vol. 2a, p. 10, idem</ref></blockquote>\\n\\nHowever, Smith added that the \"abundance or scantiness of this supply too seems to depend more upon the former of those two circumstances than upon the latter.\"<ref>Smith, A., 1976, vol. 1, p. 10, para. 4</ref>\\n\\n===Other works===\\n[[File:Adam Smith Grave.JPG|thumb|upright|Smith\\'s burial place in [[Canongate Kirkyard]]|alt=A burial]]\\n\\nShortly before his death, Smith had nearly all his manuscripts destroyed. In his last years, he seemed to have been planning two major treatises, one on the theory and history of law and one on the sciences and arts. The posthumously published \\'\\'Essays on Philosophical Subjects\\'\\', a history of [[astronomy]] down to Smith\\'s own era, plus some thoughts on [[ancient physics]] and [[metaphysics]], probably contain parts of what would have been the latter treatise. \\'\\'[[Lectures on Jurisprudence]]\\'\\' were notes taken from Smith\\'s early lectures, plus an early draft of \\'\\'The Wealth of Nations\\'\\', published as part of the 1976 Glasgow Edition of the works and correspondence of Smith. Other works, including some published posthumously, include \\'\\'Lectures on Justice, Police, Revenue, and Arms\\'\\' (1763) (first published in 1896); and \\'\\'Essays on Philosophical Subjects\\'\\' (1795).<ref>\\'\\'The Glasgow edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith\\'\\', 1982, 6 volumes</ref>\\n\\n==Legacy==\\n\\n===In economics and moral philosophy===\\n\\'\\'The Wealth of Nations\\'\\' was a precursor to the modern academic discipline of economics. In this and other works, Smith expounded how rational self-interest and competition can lead to economic prosperity. Smith was controversial in his own day and his general approach and writing style were often satirised by [[Tories (British political party)|Tory]] writers in the moralising tradition of Hogarth and Swift, as a discussion at the University of Winchester suggests.<ref>{{cite web |access-date=11 February 2010 |url=http://journalism.winchester.ac.uk/?page=343 |title=Adam Smith – Jonathan Swift |publisher=University of Winchester |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091128233435/http://journalism.winchester.ac.uk/?page=343 |archive-date=28 November 2009}}</ref> In 2005, \\'\\'The Wealth of Nations\\'\\' was named among the 100 Best Scottish Books of all time.<ref name=\"100 Best Scottish Books, Adam Smith\">[http://www.list.co.uk/articles/100-best-scottish-books/adam-smith/ 100 Best Scottish Books, Adam Smith] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020113357/http://www.list.co.uk/articles/100-best-scottish-books/adam-smith/ |date=20 October 2013 }} Retrieved 31 January 2012</ref>\\n\\nIn light of the arguments put forward by Smith and other economic theorists in Britain, academic belief in mercantilism began to decline in Britain in the late 18th century.

Had he been more brilliant, he would not have been taken so seriously. Had he dug more deeply, had he unearthed more recondite truth, had he used more difficult and ingenious methods, he would not have been understood. But he had no such ambitions; in fact he disliked whatever went beyond plain common sense. He never moved above the heads of even the dullest readers. He led them on gently, encouraging them by trivialities and homely observations, making them feel comfortable all along.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Schumpeter History of Economic Analysis |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=185}}</ref>\\n\\nClassical economists presented competing theories of those of Smith, termed the \"[[labour theory of value#The theory\\'s development|labour theory of value]]\". Later Marxian economics descending from classical economics also use Smith\\'s labour theories, in part. The first volume of [[Karl Marx]]\\'s major work, \\'\\'Das Kapital\\'\\', was published in German in 1867. In it, Marx focused on the labour theory of value and what he considered to be the exploitation of labour by capital.<ref name=\"Roemer\">[[John Roemer|Roemer, J.E.]] (1987). \"Marxian Value Analysis\". \\'\\'[[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]]\\'\\', v. 3, 383.</ref><ref>[[Ernest Mandel|Mandel, Ernest]] (1987). \"Marx, Karl Heinrich\", \\'\\'The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics\\'\\' v. 3, pp. 372, 376.</ref> The labour theory of value held that the value of a thing was determined by the labour that went into its production. This contrasts with the modern contention of [[neoclassical economics]], that the value of a thing is determined by what one is willing to give up to obtain the thing.\\n\\n[[File:Adam Smith Theatre, Bennochy Road, Kirkcaldy.jpg|thumb|The Adam Smith Theatre in [[Kirkcaldy]]|alt=A brown building]]\\n\\nThe body of theory later termed \"neoclassical economics\" or \"[[marginalism#The Marginal Revolution|marginalism]]\" formed from about 1870 to 1910. The term \"economics\" was popularised by such neoclassical economists as [[Alfred Marshall]] as a concise synonym for \"economic science\" and a substitute for the earlier, broader term \"[[political economy]]\" used by Smith.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Marshall, Alfred |author2=Marshall, Mary Paley |year=1879 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NLcJAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA1 |title=The Economics of Industry |page=2 |isbn=978-1855065475 |access-date=13 May 2020 |archive-date=13 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200613110634/https://books.google.com/books?id=NLcJAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA1 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Jevons, W.

It dispensed with the [[labour theory of value]] of which Smith was most famously identified with in classical economics, in favour of a [[marginal utility]] theory of value on the demand side and a more general theory of costs on the supply side.<ref>Campos, Antonietta (1987). \"Marginalist Economics\", \\'\\'The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics\\'\\', v. 3, p. 320</ref>\\n\\nThe bicentennial anniversary of the publication of \\'\\'The Wealth of Nations\\'\\' was celebrated in 1976, resulting in increased interest for \\'\\'The Theory of Moral Sentiments\\'\\' and his other works throughout academia. After 1976, Smith was more likely to be represented as the author of both \\'\\'The Wealth of Nations\\'\\' and \\'\\'The Theory of Moral Sentiments\\'\\', and thereby as the founder of a moral philosophy and the science of economics. His \\'\\'[[homo economicus]]\\'\\' or \"economic man\" was also more often represented as a moral person. Additionally, economists David Levy and Sandra Peart in \"The Secret History of the Dismal Science\" point to his opposition to hierarchy and beliefs in inequality, including racial inequality, and provide additional support for those who point to Smith\\'s opposition to slavery, colonialism, and empire. They show the caricatures of Smith drawn by the opponents of views on hierarchy and inequality in this online article. Emphasised also are Smith\\'s statements of the need for high wages for the poor, and the efforts to keep wages low. In The \"Vanity of the Philosopher: From Equality to Hierarchy in Postclassical Economics\", Peart and Levy also cite Smith\\'s view that a common street porter was not intellectually inferior to a philosopher,<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1977|loc=§Book I, Chapter 2}}</ref> and point to the need for greater appreciation of the public views in discussions of science and other subjects now considered to be technical. They also cite Smith\\'s opposition to the often expressed view that science is superior to common sense.<ref>\"The Vanity of the Philosopher: From Equality to Hierarchy\" in \\'\\'Postclassical Economics\\'\\' [http://www.wfu.edu/~hammond/review%20of%20Peart&Levy,%20final.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004085614/http://www.wfu.edu/~hammond/review%20of%20Peart%26Levy%2C%20final.pdf |date=4 October 2012 }}</ref>\\n\\nSmith also explained the relationship between growth of private property and civil government:\\n\\n<blockquote>Men may live together in society with some tolerable degree of security, though there is no civil magistrate to protect them from the injustice of those passions. But avarice and ambition in the rich, in the poor the hatred of labour and the love of present ease and enjoyment, are the passions which prompt to invade property, passions much more steady in their operation, and much more universal in their influence. Wherever there is great property there is great inequality. For one very rich man there must be at least five hundred poor, and the affluence of the few supposes the indigence of the many. The affluence of the rich excites the indignation of the poor, who are often both driven by want, and prompted by envy, to invade his possessions. It is only under the shelter of the civil magistrate that the owner of that valuable property, which is acquired by the labour of many years, or perhaps of many successive generations, can sleep a single night in security. He is at all times surrounded by unknown enemies, whom, though he never provoked, he can never appease, and from whose injustice he can be protected only by the powerful arm of the civil magistrate continually held up to chastise it. The acquisition of valuable and extensive property, therefore, necessarily requires the establishment of civil government. Where there is no property, or at least none that exceeds the value of two or three days\\' labour, civil government is not so necessary. Civil government supposes a certain subordination. But as the necessity of civil government gradually grows up with the acquisition of valuable property, so the principal causes which naturally introduce subordination gradually grow up with the growth of that valuable property. (...) Men of inferior wealth combine to defend those of superior wealth in the possession of their property, in order that men of superior wealth may combine to defend them in the possession of theirs. All the inferior shepherds and herdsmen feel that the security of their own herds and flocks depends upon the security of those of the great shepherd or herdsman; that the maintenance of their lesser authority depends upon that of his greater authority, and that upon their subordination to him depends his power of keeping their inferiors in subordination to them. They constitute a sort of little nobility, who feel themselves interested to defend the property and to support the authority of their own little sovereign in order that he may be able to defend their property and to support their authority. Civil government, so far as it is instituted for the security of property, is in reality instituted for the defence of the rich against the poor, or of those who have some property against those who have none at all.<ref>\\'\\'The Wealth of Nations\\'\\', Book 5, Chapter 1, Part 2</ref></blockquote>\\n\\n===In British imperial debates===\\nSmith\\'s chapter on colonies, in turn, would help shape British imperial debates from the mid-19th century onward. \\'\\'The Wealth of Nations\\'\\' would become an ambiguous text regarding the imperial question. In his chapter on colonies, Smith pondered how to solve the crisis developing across the Atlantic among the empire\\'s 13 American colonies. He offered two different proposals for easing tensions. The first proposal called for giving the colonies their independence, and by thus parting on a friendly basis, Britain would be able to develop and maintain a free-trade relationship with them, and possibly even an informal military alliance. Smith\\'s second proposal called for a theoretical imperial federation that would bring the colonies and the metropole closer together through an imperial parliamentary system and imperial free trade.<ref>E.A. Benians, \\'Adam Smith’s project of an empire\\', \\'\\'Cambridge Historical Journal\\'\\' 1 (1925): 249–83</ref>\\n\\nSmith\\'s most prominent disciple in 19th-century Britain, peace advocate [[Richard Cobden]], preferred the first proposal. Cobden would lead the [[Anti-Corn Law League]] in overturning the [[Corn Laws]] in 1846, shifting Britain to a policy of free trade and empire \"on the cheap\" for decades to come. This hands-off approach toward the British Empire would become known as [[Cobdenism]] or the [[Manchester Liberalism|Manchester School]].<ref>Anthony Howe, \\'\\'Free trade and liberal England, 1846–1946\\'\\' (Oxford, 1997)</ref> By the turn of the century, however, advocates of Smith\\'s second proposal such as [[Joseph Shield Nicholson]] would become ever more vocal in opposing Cobdenism, calling instead for imperial federation.<ref>J. Shield Nicholson, \\'\\'A project of empire: a critical study of the economics of imperialism, with special reference to the ideas of Adam Smith\\'\\' (London, 1909)</ref> As Marc-William Palen notes: \"On the one hand, Adam Smith’s late nineteenth and early twentieth-century Cobdenite adherents used his theories to argue for gradual imperial devolution and empire \\'on the cheap\\'.

[[Herbert Stein]] wrote that the people who \"wear an Adam Smith necktie\" do it to \"make a statement of their devotion to the idea of free markets and [[limited government]]\", and that this misrepresents Smith\\'s ideas. Stein writes that Smith \"was not pure or doctrinaire about this idea. He viewed government intervention in the market with great skepticism...yet he was prepared to accept or propose qualifications to that policy in the specific cases where he judged that their net effect would be beneficial and would not undermine the basically free character of the system. He did not wear the Adam Smith necktie.\" In Stein\\'s reading, \\'\\'The Wealth of Nations\\'\\' could justify the [[Food and Drug Administration]], the [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]], mandatory employer health benefits, environmentalism, and \"[[Pigovian tax|discriminatory taxation]] to deter [[sin tax|improper]] or [[sumptuary tax|luxurious behavior]]\".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stein, Herbert |date=6 April 1994 |title=Board of Contributors: Remembering Adam Smith |journal=[[The Wall Street Journal Asia]] |page=A14}}</ref>\\n\\nSimilarly, Vivienne Brown stated in \\'\\'[[The Economic Journal]]\\'\\' that in the 20th-century United States, [[Reaganomics]] supporters, \\'\\'[[The Wall Street Journal]]\\'\\', and other similar sources have spread among the general public a partial and misleading vision of Smith, portraying him as an \"extreme dogmatic defender of \\'\\'laissez-faire\\'\\' capitalism and [[supply-side economics]]\".<ref name=\"Brown93\">{{cite journal |author=Brown, Vivienne |date=January 1993 |journal=[[The Economic Journal]] |volume=103 |issue=416 |pages=230–32 |doi=10.2307/2234351 |title=Untitled review of \\'Capitalism as a Moral System: Adam Smith\\'s Critique of the Free Market Economy\\' and \\'Adam Smith and his Legacy for Modern Capitalism\\' |last2=Pack |first2=Spencer J. |last3=Werhane |first3=Patricia H. |jstor=2234351}}</ref> In fact, \\'\\'The Wealth of Nations\\'\\' includes the following statement on the payment of taxes:\\n\\n<blockquote>The subjects of every state ought to contribute towards the support of the government, as nearly as possible, in proportion to their respective abilities; that is, in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state.<ref name=\"Smith 1977 loc=bk.

I\\'\\'. Included in his requirements of a government is to enforce contracts and provide justice system, grant patents and copy rights, provide public goods such as infrastructure, provide national defence, and regulate banking. The role of the government was to provide goods \"of such a nature that the profit could never repay the expense to any individual\" such as roads, bridges, canals, and harbours. He also encouraged invention and new ideas through his patent enforcement and support of infant industry monopolies. He supported partial public subsidies for elementary education, and he believed that competition among religious institutions would provide general benefit to the society. In such cases, however, Smith argued for local rather than centralised control: \"Even those publick works which are of such a nature that they cannot afford any revenue for maintaining themselves ... are always better maintained by a local or provincial revenue, under the management of a local and provincial administration, than by the general revenue of the state\" (\\'\\'Wealth of Nations,\\'\\' V.i.d.18). Finally, he outlined how the government should support the dignity of the monarch or chief magistrate, such that they are equal or above the public in fashion. He even states that monarchs should be provided for in a greater fashion than magistrates of a republic because \"we naturally expect more splendor in the court of a king than in the mansion-house of a [[doge]]\".<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1977|loc=bk. V}}</ref> In addition, he allowed that in some specific circumstances, retaliatory tariffs may be beneficial:\\n\\n<blockquote>The recovery of a great foreign market will generally more than compensate the transitory inconvenience of paying dearer during a short time for some sorts of goods.<ref>Smith, A., 1976, \\'\\'The Glasgow edition\\'\\', vol. 2a, p. 468.</ref></blockquote>\\n\\nHowever, he added that in general, a retaliatory tariff \"seems a bad method of compensating the injury done to certain classes of our people, to do another injury ourselves, not only to those classes, but to almost all the other classes of them\".<ref>\\'\\'The Wealth of Nations,\\'\\' IV.ii.39</ref>\\n\\n[[Economic historian]]s such as [[Jacob Viner]] regard Smith as a strong advocate of free markets and limited government (what Smith called \"natural liberty\"), but not as a dogmatic supporter of \\'\\'laissez-faire\\'\\'.<ref name=\"Viner 1927\">{{cite journal |author=Viner, Jacob |date=April 1927 |journal=[[The Journal of Political Economy]] |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=198–232 |doi=10.1086/253837 |title=Adam Smith and Laissez-faire |jstor=1823421|s2cid=154539413 }}</ref>\\n\\nEconomist [[Daniel B.

Most people still fall victim to the thinking that Smith was a free-market economist without exception, though he was not. Ricardo pointed out that Smith was in support of helping infant industries. Smith believed that the government should subsidise newly formed industry, but he did fear that when the infant industry grew into adulthood, it would be unwilling to surrender the government help.<ref name=\"New Ideas From Dead Economists\">Buchholz, Todd (December 1990). pp. 38–39.</ref> Smith also supported tariffs on imported goods to counteract an internal tax on the same good. Smith also fell to pressure in supporting some tariffs in support for national defence.<ref name=\"New Ideas From Dead Economists\"/>\\n\\nSome have also claimed, [[Emma Rothschild]] among them, that Smith would have supported a minimum wage,<ref>Martin, Christopher. \"Adam Smith and Liberal Economics: Reading the Minimum Wage Debate of 1795–96,\" \\'\\'Econ Journal Watch\\'\\' 8(2): 110–25, May 2011 [http://econjwatch.org/articles/adam-smith-and-liberal-economics-reading-the-minimum-wage-debate-of-1795-96] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228230820/http://econjwatch.org/articles/adam-smith-and-liberal-economics-reading-the-minimum-wage-debate-of-1795-96 |date=28 December 2013 }}</ref> although no direct textual evidence supports the claim. Indeed, Smith wrote:\\n\\n<blockquote>The price of labour, it must be observed, cannot be ascertained very accurately anywhere, different prices being often paid at the same place and for the same sort of labour, not only according to the different abilities of the workmen, but according to the easiness or hardness of the masters. Where wages are not regulated by law, all that we can pretend to determine is what are the most usual; and experience seems to show that law can never regulate them properly, though it has often pretended to do so. (\\'\\'The Wealth of Nations\\'\\', Book 1, Chapter 8)</blockquote>\\n\\nHowever, Smith also noted, to the contrary, the existence of an [[equality of bargaining power|imbalanced, inequality of bargaining power]]:<ref>A Smith, \\'\\'Wealth of Nations\\'\\' (1776) Book I, ch 8</ref>\\n<blockquote>A landlord, a farmer, a master manufacturer, a merchant, though they did not employ a single workman, could generally live a year or two upon the stocks which they have already acquired. Many workmen could not subsist a week, few could subsist a month, and scarce any a year without employment. In the long run, the workman may be as necessary to his master as his master is to him, but the necessity is not so immediate.</blockquote>\\n\\n===Criticism===\\n\\n[[Alfred Marshall]] criticised Smith\\'s definition of the economy on several points. He argued that man should be held in equal importance to money, services in equal importance to goods, and that there must be an emphasis on human welfare instead of just wealth. The \"invisible hand\" only works well when both production and consumption operates in free markets, with small (\"atomistic\") producers and consumers allowing supply and demand to fluctuate and equilibrate. In conditions of monopoly and oligopoly, the \"invisible hand\" fails.\\n\\nNobel Prize-winning economist [[Joseph E. Stiglitz]] says, on the topic of one of Smith\\'s better-known ideas: \"the reason that the invisible hand often seems invisible is that it is often not there.\"<ref>\\'\\'The Roaring Nineties\\'\\', 2006</ref>\\n\\n== See also ==\\n* [[Critique of political economy]]\\n*[[Organizational capital]]\\n* [[List of abolitionist forerunners]]\\n* [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society of Arts]]\\n* [[List of people on banknotes#Scotland|People on Scottish banknotes]]\\n\\n==References==\\n===Informational notes===\\n{{notelist}}\\n\\n===Citations===\\n{{Reflist|refs=\\n}}\\n\\n===Bibliography===\\n* {{cite journal|doi=10.1017/S1474691300001062|title=II.

He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it. By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it. I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good. It is an affectation, indeed, not very common among merchants, and very few words need be employed in dissuading them from it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;\\n\\nThose who regard that statement as Smith\\'s central message also quote frequently Smith\\'s dictum:<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Smith, A., 1976, \\'\\'The Glasgow edition\\'\\', vol. 2a, pp. 26–27.</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>\\n\\n&lt;blockquote&gt;It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest.

Smith states that the interest of manufacturers and merchants &quot;in any particular branch of trade or manufactures, is always in some respects different from, and even opposite to, that of the public ... The proposal of any new law or regulation of commerce which comes from this order, ought always to be listened to with great precaution, and ought never be adopted till after having been long and carefully examined, not only with the most scrupulous, but with the most suspicious attention.&quot;<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite magazine |last=Gopnik |first=Adam |title=Market Man |magazine=[[The New Yorker]] |date=10 October 2010 |issue=18 October 2010 |page=82 |url=https://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2010/10/18/101018crbo_books_gopnik |access-date=27 April 2011 |archive-date=5 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110305185415/http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2010/10/18/101018crbo_books_gopnik |url-status=live }}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Thus Smith\\'s chief worry seems to be when business is given special protections or privileges from government; by contrast, in the absence of such special political favours, he believed that business activities were generally beneficial to the whole society:\\n\\n&lt;blockquote&gt;It is the great multiplication of the production of all the different arts, in consequence of the division of labour, which occasions, in a well-governed society, that universal opulence which extends itself to the lowest ranks of the people. Every workman has a great quantity of his own work to dispose of beyond what he himself has occasion for; and every other workman being exactly in the same situation, he is enabled to exchange a great quantity of his own goods for a great quantity, or, what comes to the same thing, for the price of a great quantity of theirs. He supplies them abundantly with what they have occasion for, and they accommodate him as amply with what he has occasion for, and a general plenty diffuses itself through all the different ranks of society. (\\'\\'The Wealth of Nations,\\'\\' I.i.10)&lt;/blockquote&gt;\\n\\nThe neoclassical interest in Smith\\'s statement about &quot;an invisible hand&quot; originates in the possibility of seeing it as a precursor of [[neoclassical economics]] and its concept of [[General equilibrium theory|general equilibrium]]; [[Paul Samuelson|Samuelson]]\\'s &quot;Economics&quot; refers six times to Smith\\'s &quot;invisible hand&quot;.

Indeed, until the 1940s, no one knew how to prove, even to state properly, the kernel of truth in this proposition about perfectly competitive market.&quot;\\n\\n[[File:Smith - Inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations, 1922 - 5231847.tif|thumb|170px|1922 printing of \\'\\'An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations\\'\\']]\\nVery differently, classical economists see in Smith\\'s first sentences his programme to promote &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot;. Using the physiocratical concept of the economy as a circular process, to secure growth the inputs of Period 2 must exceed the inputs of Period 1. Therefore, those outputs of Period 1 which are not used or usable as inputs of Period 2 are regarded as unproductive labour, as they do not contribute to growth. This is what Smith had heard in France from, among others, [[François Quesnay]], whose ideas Smith was so impressed by that he might have dedicated \\'\\'The Wealth of Nations\\'\\' to him had he not died beforehand.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=80}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Stewart, D., 1799, \\'\\'Essays on Philosophical Subjects, to which is prefixed An Account of the Life and Writings of the Author by Dugald Steward, F.R.S.E.\\'\\', Basil; from the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, Read by M.

Smith argued that deepening the division of labour under competition leads to greater productivity, which leads to lower prices and thus an increasing standard of living—&quot;general plenty&quot; and &quot;universal opulence&quot;—for all. Extended markets and increased production lead to the continuous reorganisation of production and the invention of new ways of producing, which in turn lead to further increased production, lower prices, and improved standards of living. Smith\\'s central message is, therefore, that under dynamic competition, a growth machine secures &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot;. Smith\\'s argument predicted Britain\\'s evolution as the workshop of the world, underselling and outproducing all its competitors. The opening sentences of the &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot; summarise this policy:\\n\\n&lt;blockquote&gt;The annual labour of every nation is the fund which originally supplies it with all the necessaries and conveniences of life which it annually consumes ... . [T]his produce ... bears a greater or smaller proportion to the number of those who are to consume it ... .[B]ut this proportion must in every nation be regulated by two different circumstances;\\n* first, by the skill, dexterity, and judgment with which its labour is generally applied; and,\\n* secondly, by the proportion between the number of those who are employed in useful labour, and that of those who are not so employed [emphasis added].<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Smith, A., 1976, vol. 2a, p. 10, idem</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>&lt;/blockquote&gt;\\n\\nHowever, Smith added that the &quot;abundance or scantiness of this supply too seems to depend more upon the former of those two circumstances than upon the latter.&quot;<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Smith, A., 1976, vol. 1, p. 10, para. 4</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>\\n\\n<h level=\"3\" i=\"14\">===Other works===</h>\\n[[File:Adam Smith Grave.JPG|thumb|upright|Smith\\'s burial place in [[Canongate Kirkyard]]|alt=A burial]]\\n\\nShortly before his death, Smith had nearly all his manuscripts destroyed.

Had he been more brilliant, he would not have been taken so seriously. Had he dug more deeply, had he unearthed more recondite truth, had he used more difficult and ingenious methods, he would not have been understood. But he had no such ambitions; in fact he disliked whatever went beyond plain common sense. He never moved above the heads of even the dullest readers. He led them on gently, encouraging them by trivialities and homely observations, making them feel comfortable all along.&quot;<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite book |title=Schumpeter History of Economic Analysis |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=185}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>\\n\\nClassical economists presented competing theories of those of Smith, termed the &quot;[[labour theory of value#The theory\\'s development|labour theory of value]]&quot;. Later Marxian economics descending from classical economics also use Smith\\'s labour theories, in part. The first volume of [[Karl Marx]]\\'s major work, \\'\\'Das Kapital\\'\\', was published in German in 1867. In it, Marx focused on the labour theory of value and what he considered to be the exploitation of labour by capital.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Roemer&quot;</attr><inner>[[John Roemer|Roemer, J.E.]] (1987). &quot;Marxian Value Analysis&quot;. \\'\\'[[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]]\\'\\', v. 3, 383.</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>[[Ernest Mandel|Mandel, Ernest]] (1987). &quot;Marx, Karl Heinrich&quot;, \\'\\'The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics\\'\\' v. 3, pp. 372, 376.</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> The labour theory of value held that the value of a thing was determined by the labour that went into its production. This contrasts with the modern contention of [[neoclassical economics]], that the value of a thing is determined by what one is willing to give up to obtain the thing.\\n\\n[[File:Adam Smith Theatre, Bennochy Road, Kirkcaldy.jpg|thumb|The Adam Smith Theatre in [[Kirkcaldy]]|alt=A brown building]]\\n\\nThe body of theory later termed &quot;neoclassical economics&quot; or &quot;[[marginalism#The Marginal Revolution|marginalism]]&quot; formed from about 1870 to 1910. The term &quot;economics&quot; was popularised by such neoclassical economists as [[Alfred Marshall]] as a concise synonym for &quot;economic science&quot; and a substitute for the earlier, broader term &quot;[[political economy]]&quot; used by Smith.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite book |author1=Marshall, Alfred |author2=Marshall, Mary Paley |year=1879 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NLcJAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA1 |title=The Economics of Industry |page=2 |isbn=978-1855065475 |access-date=13 May 2020 |archive-date=13 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200613110634/https://books.google.com/books?id=NLcJAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA1 |url-status=live }}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite book |author=Jevons, W.

After 1976, Smith was more likely to be represented as the author of both \\'\\'The Wealth of Nations\\'\\' and \\'\\'The Theory of Moral Sentiments\\'\\', and thereby as the founder of a moral philosophy and the science of economics. His \\'\\'[[homo economicus]]\\'\\' or &quot;economic man&quot; was also more often represented as a moral person. Additionally, economists David Levy and Sandra Peart in &quot;The Secret History of the Dismal Science&quot; point to his opposition to hierarchy and beliefs in inequality, including racial inequality, and provide additional support for those who point to Smith\\'s opposition to slavery, colonialism, and empire. They show the caricatures of Smith drawn by the opponents of views on hierarchy and inequality in this online article. Emphasised also are Smith\\'s statements of the need for high wages for the poor, and the efforts to keep wages low. In The &quot;Vanity of the Philosopher: From Equality to Hierarchy in Postclassical Economics&quot;, Peart and Levy also cite Smith\\'s view that a common street porter was not intellectually inferior to a philosopher,<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{harvnb|Smith|1977|loc=§Book I, Chapter 2}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> and point to the need for greater appreciation of the public views in discussions of science and other subjects now considered to be technical.

But avarice and ambition in the rich, in the poor the hatred of labour and the love of present ease and enjoyment, are the passions which prompt to invade property, passions much more steady in their operation, and much more universal in their influence. Wherever there is great property there is great inequality. For one very rich man there must be at least five hundred poor, and the affluence of the few supposes the indigence of the many. The affluence of the rich excites the indignation of the poor, who are often both driven by want, and prompted by envy, to invade his possessions. It is only under the shelter of the civil magistrate that the owner of that valuable property, which is acquired by the labour of many years, or perhaps of many successive generations, can sleep a single night in security. He is at all times surrounded by unknown enemies, whom, though he never provoked, he can never appease, and from whose injustice he can be protected only by the powerful arm of the civil magistrate continually held up to chastise it. The acquisition of valuable and extensive property, therefore, necessarily requires the establishment of civil government. Where there is no property, or at least none that exceeds the value of two or three days\\' labour, civil government is not so necessary. Civil government supposes a certain subordination. But as the necessity of civil government gradually grows up with the acquisition of valuable property, so the principal causes which naturally introduce subordination gradually grow up with the growth of that valuable property. (...) Men of inferior wealth combine to defend those of superior wealth in the possession of their property, in order that men of superior wealth may combine to defend them in the possession of theirs. All the inferior shepherds and herdsmen feel that the security of their own herds and flocks depends upon the security of those of the great shepherd or herdsman; that the maintenance of their lesser authority depends upon that of his greater authority, and that upon their subordination to him depends his power of keeping their inferiors in subordination to them. They constitute a sort of little nobility, who feel themselves interested to defend the property and to support the authority of their own little sovereign in order that he may be able to defend their property and to support their authority. Civil government, so far as it is instituted for the security of property, is in reality instituted for the defence of the rich against the poor, or of those who have some property against those who have none at all.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>\\'\\'The Wealth of Nations\\'\\', Book 5, Chapter 1, Part 2</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>&lt;/blockquote&gt;\\n\\n<h level=\"3\" i=\"17\">===In British imperial debates===</h>\\nSmith\\'s chapter on colonies, in turn, would help shape British imperial debates from the mid-19th century onward. \\'\\'The Wealth of Nations\\'\\' would become an ambiguous text regarding the imperial question. In his chapter on colonies, Smith pondered how to solve the crisis developing across the Atlantic among the empire\\'s 13 American colonies. He offered two different proposals for easing tensions. The first proposal called for giving the colonies their independence, and by thus parting on a friendly basis, Britain would be able to develop and maintain a free-trade relationship with them, and possibly even an informal military alliance. Smith\\'s second proposal called for a theoretical imperial federation that would bring the colonies and the metropole closer together through an imperial parliamentary system and imperial free trade.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>E.A.

I\\'\\'. Included in his requirements of a government is to enforce contracts and provide justice system, grant patents and copy rights, provide public goods such as infrastructure, provide national defence, and regulate banking. The role of the government was to provide goods &quot;of such a nature that the profit could never repay the expense to any individual&quot; such as roads, bridges, canals, and harbours. He also encouraged invention and new ideas through his patent enforcement and support of infant industry monopolies. He supported partial public subsidies for elementary education, and he believed that competition among religious institutions would provide general benefit to the society. In such cases, however, Smith argued for local rather than centralised control: &quot;Even those publick works which are of such a nature that they cannot afford any revenue for maintaining themselves ... are always better maintained by a local or provincial revenue, under the management of a local and provincial administration, than by the general revenue of the state&quot; (\\'\\'Wealth of Nations,\\'\\' V.i.d.18). Finally, he outlined how the government should support the dignity of the monarch or chief magistrate, such that they are equal or above the public in fashion. He even states that monarchs should be provided for in a greater fashion than magistrates of a republic because &quot;we naturally expect more splendor in the court of a king than in the mansion-house of a [[doge]]&quot;.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{harvnb|Smith|1977|loc=bk.

Indeed, Smith wrote:\\n\\n&lt;blockquote&gt;The price of labour, it must be observed, cannot be ascertained very accurately anywhere, different prices being often paid at the same place and for the same sort of labour, not only according to the different abilities of the workmen, but according to the easiness or hardness of the masters. Where wages are not regulated by law, all that we can pretend to determine is what are the most usual; and experience seems to show that law can never regulate them properly, though it has often pretended to do so. (\\'\\'The Wealth of Nations\\'\\', Book 1, Chapter 8)&lt;/blockquote&gt;\\n\\nHowever, Smith also noted, to the contrary, the existence of an [[equality of bargaining power|imbalanced, inequality of bargaining power]]:<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>A Smith, \\'\\'Wealth of Nations\\'\\' (1776) Book I, ch 8</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>\\n&lt;blockquote&gt;A landlord, a farmer, a master manufacturer, a merchant, though they did not employ a single workman, could generally live a year or two upon the stocks which they have already acquired.

The &quot;invisible hand&quot; only works well when both production and consumption operates in free markets, with small (&quot;atomistic&quot;) producers and consumers allowing supply and demand to fluctuate and equilibrate. In conditions of monopoly and oligopoly, the &quot;invisible hand&quot; fails.\\n\\nNobel Prize-winning economist [[Joseph E.
